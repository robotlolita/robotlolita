### Hi, I'm Quil✨

I'm a programmer, artist, writer, and programming language designer.  
I love cats, magical girls, pastels, and cute things.

I'm working on the [Crochet](https://github.com/qteatime/crochet) programming system.  
And I previously maintained the [Folktale](https://github.com/origamitower/folktale) functional programming library for JS.  
I also work on some [fun PL design & game dev stuff](https://robotlolita.me/works/) from time to time.

Quil is pronounced as the English letter "Q".  
Or /kjuː/ in [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet).
