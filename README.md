### Hi, I'm Quil✨

I'm a programmer, artist, writer, and programming language designer.  
I love cats, magical girls, pastels, and cute things.

[My current project](https://github.com/origamitower/purr) tries to look at ways in which programming tools could be better,  
considering views from humanities (sociology, psychology, social justice, etc), collaboration, security, and mathematics.

Quil is pronounced as the English letter "Q".  
Or /kjuː/ in [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet).
