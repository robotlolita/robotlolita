### Hi, I'm Quil✨

I'm a programmer, artist, writer, and programming language designer.  
I love cats, magical girls, pastels, and cute things.

I'm working on the [Crochet](https://github.com/qteatime/crochet) programming system.

Quil is pronounced as the English letter "Q".  
Or /kjuː/ in [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet).
